# About the Project
This proejct was created for an assigment for Advanced Web Development course at Missouri State University. I worked with a group of 4 other students to bring the project to life. The project was built using html with Bootstrap, Javascript, PHP and MySQL. We used the XAMPP as the server enviroment. We aslo used PHPStorm from JetBrains and Brackets from Adobe as our main IDEs. The database was built with MySQL CLI and MyPHPAdmin.
